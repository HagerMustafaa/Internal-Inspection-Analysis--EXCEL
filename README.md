# Internal-Inspection-Analysis---EXCEL

My first project involved working with an online client who is a master's student. He conducted an inspection analysis in the Health, Safety & Environmental (HSE) Department, comparing Social Housing Buildings and Town Squares using HSE site inspection performance evaluations in Excel. I organized the results and all the data, formatted them into a table, and created data visualizations to present the findings clearly.
